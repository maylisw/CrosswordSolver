# CrosswordSolver
Using github.com/doshea/nyt_crosswords we built an acessible database of past clues and answers for the NYT Crossword puzzle.

## Note:
To use the JSON-test program you need to install jsoncpp and curl. 
Make sure the include header for the two align with where the package is installed.

ie. <jsoncpp/json/json.h> might change

### Json Cpp
sudo apt-get install libjsoncpp-dev
iasa
### Curl
sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev
